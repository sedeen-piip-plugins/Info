# How to Contribute

If you haven't already, please email Deyu (deyu.wang@pathcore.com) your GitHub username to get an invite to this organization.

The structure in this organization looks like this, where each plugin is a repository:

```sh
Sedeen-PIIP-Plugins
|---AwesomePlugin
|---CoolPlugin
|---NeatPlugin
```

To start, create a **repository** for your plugin under the **Sedeen PIIP Plugins** organization. From here, work on your plugin however you please.

Please try to use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as your project generator. This will make your plugin easy to integrate with the existing Sedeen infrastructure.
